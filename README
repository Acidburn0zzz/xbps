See http://xbps.nopcode.org/ for information.

To build this you'll need:

  - pkg-config
  - zlib (development package with static libs)
  - openssl (development package with static libs)
  - libarchive >= 2.8.0 (development package with static libs)

Optionally to build the API documentation (enabled with BUILD_API_DOCS
make(1) argument):

  - graphviz and doxygen.

By default it will be installed into /usr/local, can be changed
by setting PREFIX and DESTDIR vars as make(1) arguments.

Just run "make" and "make DESTDIR=~/xbps install".

Good luck!
