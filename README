See http://code.google.com/p/xbps for information.

To build this you'll need:

  - pkg-config
  - zlib (development package with static libs)
  - openssl (development package with static libs)
  - libarchive >= 2.8.0 (development package with static libs)

Optionally to build the API documentation:

  - graphviz and doxygen.

Just run ./configure && make && make install. By default PREFIX is set
to `/usr/local', can be changed by setting --prefix. The DESTDIR variable
is also supported for package managers.

There are some more options that can be tweaked, see them with
`./configure --help'.

Good luck!
