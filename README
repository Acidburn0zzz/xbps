See http://xbps.nopcode.org/ for information.

To build this you'll need:

  - openssl (development package with static libs)
  - libarchive (development package with static libs, and all features
    built in: acl/attr, xz, bzip2 and zlib are REQUIRED to build the
    static binaries!)
  - proplib (development package with static lib),
    available at http://code.google.com/p/portableproplib
  - asciidoc (to build the manpages)

Optionally to build the API documentation:

  - graphviz and doxygen.

By default it will be installed into /usr/local, can be changed
by setting PREFIX and DESTDIR vars as make(1) arguments.

Just run "make" and "make DESTDIR=~/xbps install".

Good luck!
