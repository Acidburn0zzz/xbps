## XBPS

The X Binary Package System (in short XBPS) is a new binary package system **designed and implemented from scratch**. Its goal is to be fast, easy to use, bug-free, featureful and portable as much as possible.

The XBPS code is totally compatible with POSIX/SUSv2/C99 standards, and released with a **Simplified BSD license (2 clause)**. There is a well documented API provided by the XBPS Library that is the basis for its frontends to handle binary packages and repositories. Some highlights:

 * Supports multiple local and remote repositories (FTP/HTTP/HTTPS).
 * SHA256 hashes for package metadata, files and binary packages.
 * Supports package states (ala dpkg) to mitigate broken package installs/updates.
 * Ability to resume partial package install/updates.
 * Ability to unpack only files that have been modified in package updates.
 * Ability to use virtual packages.
 * Ability to replace packages.
 * Ability to put packages on hold (to never update them. NEW in 0.16).
 * Ability to preserve/update configuration files.
 * Ability to force reinstallation of any installed package.
 * Ability to downgrade any installed package.
 * Ability to execute pre/post install/remove/update scriptlets.
 * Ability to check package integrity: missing files, hashes, missing or unresolved (reverse)dependencies, dangling or modified symlinks, etc.
 * Low memory footprint.
 * Fast dependency resolver and sorting algorithms.

The latest stable version **0.24** was released on **May 2nd, 2013**.

### Build requirements

To build this you'll need:

  - GNU make
  - pkg-config
  - zlib
  - openssl
  - libarchive[0] >= 3.0.2
  - confuse[1] >= 2.7

and optionally:

  - graphviz and doxygen (--with-api-docs) to build API documentation.
  - atf >= 0.15 (--with-tests) to build the Kyua test suite [2].

### Build instructions

Standard configure script (not generated by GNU autoconf).

```
./configure --prefix=/blah
make -jX
make install
```

By default PREFIX is set `/usr/local` and may be changed by setting `--prefix` in the
`configure` script. The `DESTDIR` variable is also supported at the install stage.

There are some more options that can be tweaked, see them with
`./configure --help'.

Good luck!
