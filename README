See http://xbps.nopcode.org/ for information.

To build this you'll need:

- openssl (development package)
- libarchive (development package, all features built in)
- proplib (development package),
  available at http://code.google.com/p/portableproplib
- asciidoc (to build the manpages)

By default it will be installed into /usr/local, can be changed
by setting PREFIX and DESTDIR vars as make(1) arguments.

Good luck!
