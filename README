See http://code.google.com/p/xbps for information.

To build this you'll need:

  - GNU make, pkg-config, zlib, openssl, libarchive[0] >= 3.0.2, confuse[1] >= 2.7.

and optionally:

  - graphviz and doxygen (--with-api-docs) to build API documentation.
  - atf >= 0.15 (--with-tests) to build the Kyua test suite [2].

Just run ./configure && make && make install. By default PREFIX is set
to `/usr/local', can be changed by setting --prefix. The DESTDIR variable
is also supported for package managers.

There are some more options that can be tweaked, see them with
`./configure --help'.

Good luck!
