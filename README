See http://code.google.com/p/xbps for information.

To build this you'll need:

  - pkg-config.
  - zlib (development package with static libs).
  - openssl (development package with static libs).
  - libarchive >= 2.8.0 (development package with static libs) [0].
  - confuse >= 2.7 (development package with static libs) [1].

and optionally:

  - graphviz and doxygen (--with-api-docs) to build API documentation.
  - atf >= 0.15 (--with-tests) to build the Kyua test suite [2].

Just run ./configure && make && make install. By default PREFIX is set
to `/usr/local', can be changed by setting --prefix. The DESTDIR variable
is also supported for package managers.

There are some more options that can be tweaked, see them with
`./configure --help'.

Good luck!
