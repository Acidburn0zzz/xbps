## XBPS

The X Binary Package System (in short XBPS) is a new binary package system **designed and implemented from scratch**. Its goal is to be fast, easy to use, bug-free, featureful and portable as much as possible.

The XBPS code is totally **compatible with POSIX/SUSv2/C99 standards**, and released with a **Simplified BSD license (2 clause)**. There is a well documented API provided by the XBPS Library that is the basis for its frontends to handle binary packages and repositories. Some highlights:

 * Supports **multiple local and remote repositories** (FTP/HTTP/HTTPS).
 * **SHA256 hashes** for package metadata, files and binary packages.
 * Supports **package states** (ala dpkg) to mitigate broken package installs/updates.
 * Ability to **resume** partial package install/updates.
 * Ability to **unpack only files that have been modified** in package updates.
 * Ability to use **virtual packages**.
 * Ability to **replace packages**.
 * Ability to **put packages on hold** (to never update them. NEW in 0.16).
 * Ability to **preserve/update configuration files**.
 * Ability to **force reinstallation** of any installed package.
 * Ability to **downgrade any** installed package.
 * Ability to **execute pre/post install/remove/update scriptlets**.
 * Ability to **check package integrity**: missing files, hashes, missing or unresolved (reverse)dependencies, dangling or modified symlinks, etc.
 * **Low memory** footprint.
 * **Fast** dependency resolver and sorting algorithms.

The latest stable version **0.25** was released on **July 5th, 2013**.

### Build requirements

To build this you'll need:

  - [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
  - [pkg-config](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
  - [zlib](http://www.zlib.net)
  - [openssl](http://www.openssl.org)
  - [libarchive >= 2.8.0](http://www.libarchive.org)
  - [confuse >= 2.7](http://www.nongnu.org/confuse)

and optionally:

  - [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) and [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) (--with-api-docs) to build API documentation.
  - [atf >= 0.15](http://code.google.com/p/kyua) (--with-tests) to build the Kyua test suite [2].

### Build instructions

Standard configure script (not generated by GNU autoconf).

```
./configure --prefix=/blah
make -jX
make install
```

By default PREFIX is set `/usr/local` and may be changed by setting `--prefix` in the
`configure` script. The `DESTDIR` variable is also supported at the install stage.

There are some more options that can be tweaked, see them with
`./configure --help'.

Good luck!
