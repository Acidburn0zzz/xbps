.SH "NAME"
xbps-bin \- XBPS command for binary packages
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBxbps\-bin\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fItarget\fR [\fIpkgname\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The xbps\-bin(8) command is used to handle binary packages created for the XBPS binary package system\&. You can use it to install, remove, update, list or show information about any binary package\&. Binary packages can be installed from \fIlocal (directories)\fR or \fIremote repositories (http, https or ftp)\fR, see xbps\-repo(8) for information about repositories\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcachedir\fR
.RS 4
Sets the cache directory to store downloaded binary packages from remote repositories\&. By default it\(cqs set to
\fI/var/cache/xbps\fR
and it\(cqs always relative to the
\fIroot directory\fR\&. So if you use a
\fIrootdir\fR
of
\fI/blah\fR, it will become
\fI/blah/cachedir\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Enables extra debugging output to be shown to stderr\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR
.RS 4
Only show the URLs to download the binary packages from repositories\&. This is useful if you want to download them by other means, and later you can move them to the
\fIcachedir\fR
to start the installation\&. This option can be used for the install, update and autoupdate targets\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F\fR
.RS 4
Used currently in the
\fIremove\fR
target\&. If set, package will be removed even if other packages are currently depending on it, i\&.e package is a dependency of other packages\&.
\fIUse this option with care\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Used currently in the
\fIpurge\fR,
\fIreconfigure\fR
and
\fIremove\fR
targets\&. If set,
\fIpackage(s)\fR
will be
\fIreconfigured\fR
regardless of its state in the reconfigure target, or to
\fIforce\fR
removal of package files even if its hash doesn\(cqt match in the
\fIpurge\fR
and
\fIremove\fR
targets\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Used currently in the
\fIremove\fR
and
\fIautoremove\fR
targets, if enabled after removing a package it is also purged\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-R\fR
.RS 4
Used currently in the
\fIremove\fR
target, to recursively remove packages that aren\(cqt required by other installed packages and that were installed by the package that we want to remove\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR \fIrootdir\fR
.RS 4
Sets the
\fIroot\fR
directory\&. By default the root directory is set to
\fI/\fR\&. Please note that the database directory is always set to
\fI/var/db/xbps\fR
independently of
\fIrootdir\fR\&. So if you use a rootdir of
\fI/blah\fR, metadata stuff will go into
\fI/blah/var/db/xbps\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Shows verbose messages\&. Useful while installing and removing packages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-y\fR
.RS 4
Assume
\fIyes\fR
to all questions\&. This will bypass all questions and immediately proceed with the task, use this option with care\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR
.RS 4
Shows the current XBPS release version (library and code)\&.
.RE
.SH "TARGETS"
.sp
Please note that all targets are case insensitive\&.
.PP
\fBautoremove\fR
.RS 4
Removes leaf packages\&. These packages were installed as dependencies and currently there is not any package depending on it, directly or indirectly\&. Usually it is safe to always answer yes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBautoupdate\fR
.RS 4
Updates all currently installed packages to the most newer version available in repository pool\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcheck \fR\fB\fIpkgname(s) | all\fR\fR
.RS 4
Checks for integrity errors in installed packages\&. The checks are to found missing run\-time dependencies, missing and modified package files and metadata files\&. If the
\fIall\fR
keyword is used, all packages currently installed will be checked, otherwise only
\fIpkgname(s)\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfind\-files \fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR
.RS 4
Prints the name of the installed
\fIpackage(s)\fR
matching the pattern on its file list\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBinstall \fR\fB\fIpkgname(s) | pkgpattern(s)\fR\fR
.RS 4
Install binary package(s) from repository pool by specifying
\fIpkgname(s)\fR
or
\fIpackage pattern(s)\fR\&. The first repository matching the arguments will be used\&. The package(s) will be
\fIdownloaded\fR
(if found in a remote repository),
\fIunpacked\fR
and
\fIconfigured\fR\&. The
\fIunpack\fR
stage will execute the pre\-install action on its INSTALL script, and unpack its files\&. The
\fIconfigure\fR
stage will run the post\-install action set on its INSTALL script and will change its
\fIstate\fR
to installed in the package database\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlist [\fR\fB\fIstate\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.RS 4
Lists all currently installed packages\&. Optionally another argument can be specified to list only packages with the specified
\fIstate\fR\&. By default only packages that are
\fIfully installed\fR
will be listed if
\fIstate\fR
has not been specified\&. Accepted states are:
\fIconfig\-files\fR,
\fIunpacked\fR
and
\fIinstalled\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlist\-manual\fR
.RS 4
Lists packages that were installed manually by the user, i\&.e not as dependencies of any other package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpurge \fR\fB\fIpkgname | all\fR\fR
.RS 4
Purge an installed package:
\fIpkgname\fR
or
\fIall\fR
packages\&. The purge stage runs the post\-remove action set in the REMOVE script in its metadata directory
\fI(/var/db/xbps/metadata/pkgname)\fR
and will remove configuration (if they were not modified by the user) and metadata files\&. The package will be fully removed from the system once it has been purged\&. If
\fB\-f\fR
option is used, configuration files that have been
\fImodified WILL BE REMOVED\&. BEWARE WITH THIS!\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBreconfigure \fR\fB\fIpkgname | all\fR\fR
.RS 4
Reconfigure an unpacked package\&. Packages in this state are not fully installed, because they were not configured for whatever reason\&. The configure stage will run the post\-install action set on its INSTALL script and will change its state to installed in the package database\&. The
\fIall\fR
keyword can be used to reconfigure all not configured packages\&. If
\fB\-f\fR
option is used, the package will be reconfigured even if its state is already installed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBremove \fR\fB\fIpkgname(s)\fR\fR
.RS 4
Removes the installed package
\fIpkgname(s)\fR\&. Its files will be removed and its state will be changed to
\fIconfig\-files\fR
in the package database\&. Configuration files, its metadata directory/files and its information in the package database are preserved\&. To fully remove a package in
\fIconfig\-files\fR
state, it must be purged with the
\fIpurge\fR
command or alternatively use the
\fB\-p\fR
flag \&. If
\fB\-f\fR
option is used, package files will be
\fBremoved even if its SHA256 hash don\(cqt match\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBset\-prop \fR\fB\fIproperty\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Sets a
\fIproperty\fR
for a package as specified in
\fIpkgname\fR\&. See the
\fIPROPERTIES\fR
section below for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBunset\-prop \fR\fB\fIproperty\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Unsets a
\fIproperty\fR
for a package as specified in
\fIpkgname\fR\&. See the
\fIPROPERTIES\fR
section below for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Shows information for installed package
\fIpkgname\fR\&. This will print the size it takes in filesystem, description, maintainer, architecture and other information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-deps \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Shows the list of dependencies that pkgname requires at run time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-files \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Shows the list of files that pkgname contains\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-orphans\fR
.RS 4
Shows the list of package orphans currently installed\&. Package orphans are packages that were installed as dependencies of another package, but no other package currently depends on\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-revdeps \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Shows the reverse dependencies for
\fIpkgname\fR\&. Reverse dependencies are packages that are currently depending in pkgname directly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBupdate \fR\fB\fIpkgname(s)\fR\fR
.RS 4
Updates
\fIpkgname(s)\fR
to the most newer version available in repository pool\&. This can be used if only
\fIpkgname(s)\fR
need to be updated, unlike the
\fIautoupdate\fR
target that will update all currently installed packages\&.
.RE
.SH "PACKAGE STATES"
.sp
A package can be in a different state while it is being installed, removed, unpacked, configured or purged\&. The following states are available:
.PP
\fBinstalled\fR
.RS 4
The package is fully installed, that means it was unpacked and configured correctly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBunpacked\fR
.RS 4
The package has been unpacked in destination root directory, but it is not fully installed because it was not yet configured\&. Please note, that some packages will do not work if they are only unpacked\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBconfig\-files\fR
.RS 4
The package has been removed but configuration files and its metadata directory are still available (and it is still registered in the package database)\&. You can purge safely packages that are in this state, modified configuration files will be preserved\&.
.RE
.SH "PROPERTIES"
.sp
Properties can be specified for packages to control behaviour of some aspects in XBPS\&. The following is the list of properties currently implemented:
.PP
\fBhold\fR
.RS 4
When this property is set for a package, it will be put on
\fIhold\fR
i\&.e the package won\(cqt be updated even if there is a newer version in registered repositories\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBupdate\-first\fR
.RS 4
When this property is set, the package will always be updated before all other packages, regardless of its package dependencies\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBvirtual\fR
.RS 4
When this property is set, the virtual packages that target package supports via the
\fBprovides\fR
object will have preference over other packages matching its
\fIpackage name\fR\&. A real example is any package that
\fIprovides\fR
the
\fBsyslog\-daemon\-0\fR
virtual package, if there are two packages supporting this you can choose which one will be installed\&.
