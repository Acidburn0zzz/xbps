.SH "NAME"
xbps-bin \- XBPS command for binary packages
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBxbps\-bin\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fItarget\fR [\fIpkgname\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The xbps\-bin(8) command is used to handle binary packages created for the \fBXBPS binary package system\fR\&. You can use it to install, remove, list or show information about any binary package\&. Binary packages can be installed from local (\fIdirectory\fR) or remote repositories (\fIhttp\fR, \fIhttps\fR or \fIftp\fR), see xbps\-repo(8) for information about repositories\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcachedir\fR
.RS 4
Sets the
\fIcache\fR
directory to store downloaded binary packages from remote repositories\&. By default it\(cqs set to
\fI/var/cache/xbps\fR
and it\(cqs always relative to the
\fIroot\fR
directory\&. So if you use a
\fIrootdir\fR
of
\fI/blah\fR, it will become
\fI/blah/cachedir\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Used currently in the
\fIpurge\fR,
\fIreconfigure\fR
and
\fIremove\fR
targets\&. If set, package(s) will be reconfigured regardless of its state if working with the
\fIreconfigure target, or to force removal of package files even if its hash doesn\(cqt match in the "purge\fR"
and
\fIremove\fR
targets\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Used currently in the
\fIremove\fR
and
\fIautoremove\fR
targets, if enabled after removing a package it is also purged\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR \fIrootdir\fR
.RS 4
Sets the
\fIroot\fR
directory\&. By default the root directory is set to
\fI/\fR\&. Please note that the database directory is always set to
\fI/var/db/xbps\fR
independently of
\fIrootdir\fR\&. So if you use a
\fIrootdir\fR
of
\fI/blah\fR, metadata stuff will go into
\fI/blah/var/db/xbps\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Shows verbose messages\&. Useful while installing and removing packages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-y\fR
.RS 4
Assume "yes" to all questions\&. This will bypass all questions and immediately proceed with the task, use this option with care\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR
.RS 4
Shows the current XBPS release version (library and code)\&.
.RE
.SH "TARGETS"
.sp
Please note that all targets are \fBcase insensitive\fR\&.
.PP
\fBautoremove\fR
.RS 4
Removes
\fIleaf\fR
packages\&. These packages were installed as dependencies and currently there is not any package depending on it, directly or indirectly\&. Usually it is safe to always answer
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBautoupdate\fR
.RS 4
Updates all currently installed packages to the most newer version available in repository pool\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcheck \fR\fB\fIpkgname(s)\fR\fR\fB | \fR\fB\fIall\fR\fR
.RS 4
Checks for integrity errors in installed packages\&. The checks are to found missing run\-time dependencies, missing and modified package files and metadata files\&. If the
\fBall\fR
keyword is used,
\fIall\fR
packages currently installed will be checked, otherwise only
\fBpkgname\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfind-files\fR \fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR
.RS 4
Prints the name of the installed "\fBpackage(s)\fR" matching the \fBpattern\fR on its file list.
.RE
.PP
\fBinstall \fR\fB\fIpkgname(s)\fR\fR\fB | \fR\fB\fIpkgpattern(s)\fR\fR
.RS 4
Install binary package(s) from repository pool by specifying "\fBpkgname(s)\fR" or "\fBpackage pattern(s)\fR"\&. The first repository matching the arguments will be used\&. The package(s) will be
\fIdownload\fR
(if working with a remote repository),
\fIunpacked\fR
and
\fIconfigured\fR\&. The
\fIunpack stage will execute the \fR\fI\fBpre\-install\fR\fR\fI action on its \fR\fI\fBINSTALL\fR\fR\fI script, and unpack its files\&. The "configure\fR"
stage will run the
\fBpost\-install\fR
action set on its
\fBINSTALL\fR
script and will change its state to
\fBinstalled\fR
in the package database\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlist [\fR\fB\fIstate\fR\fR]
.RS 4
Lists all currently installed packages\&. Optionally another argument can be specified to
list only packages with the specified \fIstate\fR. By default only packages that are fully
installed will be listed if no \fIstate\fR has been specified. Accepted states are:
\fBconfig\-files\fR, \fBunpacked\fR and \fBinstalled\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBlist\-manual\fR
.RS 4
Lists packages that were installed
\fImanually\fR
by the user, i\&.e not as dependencies of any other package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpurge \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR\fB | \fR\fB\fIall\fR\fR
.RS 4
Purge an installed package,
\fBpkgname\fR
or
\fBall\fR
packages\&. The
\fIpurge\fR
stage runs the
\fBpost\-remove\fR
action set in the
\fBREMOVE\fR
script in its metadata directory ( /var/db/xbps/metadata/\fIpkgname\fR
) and will remove configuration (if they were not modified by the user) and metadata files\&. The package will be fully removed from the system once it has been
\fBpurged\fR\&. If
\fB\-f\fR
option is used, configuration files that have been modified
\fBWILL BE REMOVED, BEWARE WITH THIS!\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreconfigure \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR\fB | \fR\fB\fIall\fR\fR
.RS 4
Reconfigure an
\fBunpacked\fR
package\&. Packages in this state are not fully installed, because they were not configured for whatever reason\&. The
\fIconfigure\fR
stage will run the
\fIpost\-install\fR
action set on its
\fBINSTALL\fR
script and will change its state to
\fBinstalled\fR
in the package database\&. The
\fIall\fR
keyword can be used to reconfigure all not configured packages\&. If
\fB\-f\fR
option is used, the package will be reconfigured even if its state is already
\fBinstalled\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBremove \fR\fB\fIpkgname(s)\fR\fR
.RS 4
Removes the installed package
\fIpkgname(s)\fR\&. Its files will be removed and its state will be changed to
\fBconfig\-files\fR
in the package database\&. Configuration files, its metadata directory/files and its information in the package database are preserved\&. To fully remove a package in
\fBconfig\-files\fR
state, it must be
\fBpurged\fR
with the
\fBpurge\fR
command\&. If
\fB\-f\fR
option is used, package files will be removed even if its SHA256 hash doesn\(cqt match\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Shows information for installed package
\fIpkgname\fR\&. This will print the size it takes in filesystem, description, maintainer, architecture and other information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-deps \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Shows the list of dependencies that
\fIpkgname\fR
requires at run time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-files \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Shows the list of files that
\fIpkgname\fR
contains\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-orphans\fR
.RS 4
Shows the list of package orphans currently installed. Package orphans
are packages that were installed as dependencies of another package, but
no other package currently depends on.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-revdeps \fR\fB\fIpkgname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Shows the reverse dependencies for
\fIpkgname\fR\&. Reverse dependencies are packages that are currently depending in
\fIpkgname\fR
directly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBupdate \fR\fB\fIpkgname(s)\fR\fR
.RS 4
Updates
\fIpkgname(s)\fR
to the most newer version available in repository pool\&. This can be used if only
\fIpkgname(s)\fR
needs to be updated, unlike the
\fBautoupdate\fR
target that will update all currently installed packages\&.
.RE
.SH "PACKAGE STATES"
.sp
A package can be in a different state while it is being installed, removed, unpacked, configured or purged\&. The following states are available:
.PP
\fBinstalled\fR
.RS 4
The package is fully installed, that means it was unpacked and configured correctly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBunpacked\fR
.RS 4
The package has been unpacked in destination root directory, but it is not fully installed because it was not yet configured\&. Please note, that some packages will do not work if they are only unpacked\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBconfig\-files\fR
.RS 4
The package has been removed but configuration files and its metadata directory are still available (and it is still registered in the package database)\&. You can
\fIpurge\fR
safely packages that are in this state, modified configuration files will be preserved\&.
