.Sh NAME
.Nm xbps-bin
.Nd XBPS command for binary packages
.Sh SYNOPSYS
.Nm xbps-bin
.Op options
.Op target
.Op pkgname(s)|pkgpattern(s)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
ommand is used to handle binary packages created for the XBPS binary
package system. You can use it to install, remove, update, list or show information
about any binary package. Binary packages can be installed from
.Em local
(directories)
or
.Em remote
repositories (http, https or ftp), see
.Xr xbps-repo 8
for information about repositories.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl A
Sets the
.Em automatic-install
boolean object for a package, therefore explicitly
setting that package was installed as it were a dependency, even if it is not.
Use of this option takes effect in the
.Em autoupdate ,
.Em install
and
.Em update
targets.
Targetted packages and its required dependencies will be matched.
.It Fl C Ar conffile
Full path to the XBPS configuration file. By default set to
.Pa /etc/xbps/xbps.conf .
.It Fl c Ar cachedir
Sets the
.Em cache
directory to store downloaded binary packages from remote
repositories. By default set to
.Pa /var/cache/xbps .
.It Fl d
Enables extra debugging output to be shown to stderr.
.It Fl D
Only show the URLs to download the binary packages from repositories. This is
useful if you want to download them by other means, and later you can move
them to the cachedir to start the installation. This option can be used for
the install, update and autoupdate targets.
.It Fl F
Used currently in the
.Em remove
target. If set, package will be removed even if other packages are currently
depending on it, i.e package is a dependency of any other installed package.
.It Fl f
Used currently in the
.Em purge ,
.Em reconfigure
and
.Em remove
targets. If set, package(s) will be reconfigured regardless of its state in
.Em reconfigure
target, or to
.Em force
removal of package files even if its hash does not match in the
.Em purge
and
.Em remove
targets.
.It Fl M
Sets the
.Em automatic-install
boolean object for package to false, therefore
explicitly setting that package was installed manually by the user. Use of this
option takes effect in the
.Em autoupdate ,
.Em install
and
.Em update
targets
and target packages and its required dependencies will be matched.
.It Fl o Ar key Op key2,...
Used currently in the
.Em show
target. Prints the value of specified key(s) from
package's properties dictionary. Multiple keys can be specified delimited by
the comma character.
.It Fl p
Used currently in the
.Em remove
and
.Em autoremove
targets. If enabled, after removing
a package it is also purged.
.It Fl R
Used currently in the
.Em remove
target. If set, recursively removes packages that
are not required by any other installed package and that were installed by
the package that we want to remove.
.It Fl r Ar rootdir
Sets the
.Em root
directory. By default the root directory is set to
.Em / .
Please note that the database directory is always set to
.Pa /var/db/xbps
independently of rootdir setting. So if you use a rootdir of
.Pa /blah ,
metadata stuff will go into
.Pa /blah/var/db/xbps .
.It Fl v
Shows verbose messages. Useful while installing and removing packages.
.It Fl y
Assume
.Em yes
to all questions. This will bypass all questions and immediately proceed
with the task.
.It Fl V
Shows the current XBPS release version (version, API, index).
.Sh TARGETS
Please note that all targets are case insensitive.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ident
.It Sy autoremove
Removes package orphans. These packages were installed as dependencies and
currently there is not any package depending on it, directly or indirectly.
Usually it is safe to always answer yes.
.It Sy autoupdate
Updates all currently installed packages to the newest version available in
all repositories.
.It Sy check Ar pkgname | Ar all
Checks for integrity errors in installed packages. The checks are to found
missing run-time dependencies, missing and modified package files and
metadata files. If the all keyword is used, all packages currently installed
will be checked, otherwise just pkgname.
.It Sy find-files Ar pattern
Prints the name of the installed
.Em package(s)
matching the pattern on its file list.
.It Sy install Ar pkgname(s) | Ar pkgpattern(s)
Install binary package(s) from repository pool by specifying
.Em pkgname(s)
or
.Em package pattern(s) .
The first repository matching the arguments will be used. The package(s) will be
.Em downloaded
(if found in a remote repository),
.Em unpacked
and
.EM configured .
The
.Em unpack
stage will execute the pre-install action on its INSTALL script, and unpack its files.
The
.Em configure
stage will run the post-install action set on its INSTALL script and will change its
.Em state
to installed in the package database.
.It Sy list Op state
Lists all currently installed packages. Optionally another argument can be specified
to list only packages with the specified
.Op state .
By default only packages fully installed will be listed if
.Em state
has not been specified. Accepted states are:
.Em config-files ,
.Em half-unpacked ,
.Em unpacked ,
and
.Em installed .
.It Sy list-manual
Lists packages that were installed manually by the user, i.e not as dependencies
of any other package.
.It Sy purge Ar pkgname | Ar all
Purge an installed package:
.Em pkgname
or
.Em all
packages. The purge stage runs the post-remove action set in the REMOVE script
in its metadata directory
.Pa (/var/db/xbps/metadata/pkgname)
and will remove configuration (if they were not modified by the user) and
metadata files. The package will be fully removed from the system once it
has been purged. If
.Ql -f
option is used, configuration files that have been
.Em modified WILL BE REMOVED. BEWARE WITH THIS!
.It Sy reconfigure Ar pkgname | Ar all
Reconfigure an unpacked package. Packages in this state are not fully installed,
because they were not configured for whatever reason. The configure stage will
run the post-install action set on its INSTALL script and will change its state
to installed in the package database. The
.Em all
keyword can be used to reconfigure all not configured packages. If
.Ql -f
option is used, the package will be reconfigured even if its state is already installed.
.It Sy remove Ar pkgname(s)
Removes the installed package
.Em pkgname(s) .
Its files will be removed and its state will be changed to
.Em config-files
in the package database. Configuration files, its metadata directory/files and its
information in the package database are preserved. To fully remove a package in
.Em config-files
state, it must be purged with the
.Em purge
command or alternatively use the
.Ql -p
flag. If
.Ql -f
option is used, package files will be
.Em removed even if its SHA256 hash don't match .
.It Sy show Ar pkgname
Shows information for installed package
.Em pkgname .
This will print the size it takes in filesystem, description, maintainer,
architecture and other useful information.
.It Sy show-deps Ar pkgname
Shows the list of dependencies that
.Em pkgname
requires at run time.
.It Sy show-files Ar pkgname
Shows the list of files that
.Em pkgname
contains.
.It Sy show-orphans
Shows the list of package orphans currently installed. Package orphans are
packages that were installed as dependencies of another package, but no other
package currently depends on.
.It Sy show-revdeps Ar pkgname
Shows the reverse dependencies for
.Em pkgname .
Reverse dependencies are packages that are currently depending in
.Em pkgname
directly.
.It Sy update Ar pkgname(s)
Updates
.Em pkgname(s)
to the most newer version available in repository pool. This can be used if only
.Em pkgname(s)
need to be updated, unlike the
.Em autoupdate
target that will update all currently installed packages.
.Sh PACKAGE STATES
A package can be in a different state while it is being
.Em installed ,
.Em removed ,
.Em unpacked ,
.Em configured
or
.Em purged .
The following states are available:
.Bl -tag -width ident
.It Sy installed
The package is fully installed, that means it was unpacked and configured correctly.
.It Sy half-unpacked
The package was being unpacked but didn't finish properly for unknown reasons.
.It Sy unpacked
The package has been unpacked in destination root directory, but it is not fully
installed because it was not yet configured. Please note that some packages will
do not work if they are only unpacked.
.It Sy config-files
The package has been removed but configuration files and its metadata directory
are still available (and it is still registered in the package database).
You can purge safely packages that are in this state, modified configuration
files will be preserved.
