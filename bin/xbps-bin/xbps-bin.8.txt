XBPS-BIN(8)
===========


NAME
----
xbps-bin - XBPS command for binary packages


SYNOPSYS
--------
*xbps-bin* ['options'] 'target' ['pkgname']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The xbps-bin(8) command is used to handle binary packages created
for the *XBPS binary package system*. You can use it to install, remove,
list or show information about any binary package. Binary packages can
be installed from local ('directory') or remote repositories ('http',
'https' or 'ftp'), see xbps-repo(1) for information about repositories.


OPTIONS
-------
*-c* 'cachedir'::
	Sets the 'cache' directory to store downloaded binary packages
	from remote repositories.
	By default it's set to '/var/cache/xbps' and it's always relative
	to the 'root' directory. So if you use a 'rootdir' of '/blah',
	it will become '/blah/cachedir'.

*-f*::
	By default while installing or removing packages, xbps-bin(1)
	will ask you if you are sure about the task that will be done.
	This option bypasses the question and executes the task immediately.
	Use this option carefully.

*-r* 'rootdir'::
	Sets the 'root' directory. By default the root directory is
	set to '/'. Please note that the database directory is always
	set to '/var/db/xbps' independently of 'rootdir'. So if you
	use a 'rootdir' of '/blah', metadata stuff will go into
	'/blah/var/db/xbps'.

*-v*::
	Shows verbose messages. Useful while installing and removing packages.

*-V*::
	Shows the current XBPS release version (library and code).


TARGETS
-------
Please note that all targets are *case insensitive*.

*autoremove*::
	Removes 'leaf' packages. These packages were installed as dependencies
	and currently there is not any package depending on it, directly or
	indirectly. Usually it is safe to always answer 'yes'.

*autoupdate*::
	Updates all currently installed packages to the most newer version
	available in repository pool.

*check 'pkgname' | 'all'*::
	Checks for integrity errors in installed packages. The checks
	are to found missing run-time dependencies, missing and modified
	package files and metadata files. If the *all* keyword is used,
	'all' packages currently installed will be checked, otherwise only
	*pkgname*.

*install 'pkgname'*::
	Install binary package "*pkgname*" by searching it in the
	repository pool. The package will be 'download' (if working with
	a remote repository), 'unpacked' and 'configured'. The 'unpack stage will
	execute the *pre-install* action on its *INSTALL* script, and unpack its files.
	The 'configure' stage will run the *post-install* action set on its
	*INSTALL* script and will change its state to *installed* in the
	package database.

*list*::
	Lists all currently installed packages.

*list-manual*::
	Lists packages that were installed 'manually' by the user, i.e
	not as dependencies of any other package.

*purge 'pkgname' | 'all'*::
	Purge an installed package, *pkgname* or *all* packages. The 'purge'
	stage runs the *post-remove* action set in the *REMOVE* script in its
	metadata directory ( /var/db/xbps/metadata/'pkgname' ) and will
	remove configuration (if they were not modified by the user) and
	metadata files. The package will be fully removed from the system once
	it has been *purged*.

*reconfigure 'pkgname' | 'all'*::
	Reconfigure an *unpacked* package. Packages in this state are not
	fully installed, because they were not configured for whatever reason.
	The 'configure' stage will run the 'post-install' action set on its
	*INSTALL* script and will change its state to *installed* in the
	package database. The 'all' keyword can be used to reconfigure all
	not configured packages. If *-f* option is used, the package will be
	reconfigured even if its state is already *installed*.

*remove 'pkgname'*::
	Removes the installed package 'pkgname'. Its files will be removed
	and its state will be changed to *config-files* in the package
	database. Configuration files, its metadata directory/files and
	its information in the package database are preserved. To fully remove
	a package in *config-files* state, it must be *purged* with the
	*purge* command.

*show 'pkgname'*::
	Shows information for installed package 'pkgname'. This will print
	the size it takes in filesystem, description, maintainer, architecture
	and other information.

*show-deps 'pkgname'*::
	Shows the list of dependencies that 'pkgname' requires at run time.

*show-files 'pkgname'*::
	Shows the list of files that 'pkgname' contains.

*show-revdeps 'pkgname'*::
	Shows the reverse dependencies for 'pkgname'. Reverse dependencies
	are packages that are currently depending in 'pkgname' directly.

*update 'pkgname'*::
	Updates 'pkgname' to the most newer version available in repository
	pool. This can be used if only 'pkgname' needs to be updated, unlike
	the *autoupdate* target that will update all currently installed
	packages.


PACKAGE STATES
--------------
A package can be in a different state while it is being installed, removed,
unpacked, configured or purged. The following states are available:

*installed*::
	The package is fully installed, that means it was unpacked and
	configured correctly.

*unpacked*::
	The package has been unpacked in destination root directory, but
	it is not fully installed because it was not yet configured. Please
	note, that some packages will do not work if they are only unpacked.

*config-files*::
	The package has been removed but configuration files and its metadata
	directory are still available (and it is still registered
	in the package database). You can 'purge' safely packages that are
	in this state, modified configuration files will be preserved.

Probably, but I try to make this not happen. Use it under your own
responsability and enjoy your life.

To build binary packages, the xbps-src(8) shell script is the command
designed for this task. This must be retrieved from a GIT repository,
available at '<http://repo.or.cz/w/xbps.git>'.
