.Sh SYNOPSYS
.Nm xbps-pkgdb

.Op PKGNAME...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can check/fix issues and modify the package database (pkgdb).
It's able to check for missing dependencies, modified files and symlinks,
and more errors that have been fixed in newer versions of xbps. A mode to update
the format to the latest version is also available.
This is the list of things that
.Nm
currently does:
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Sy METADATA CHECK
Checks that package metadata files have not been modified by comparing original
hash that is recorded when package is installed against current one.
.It Sy FILES CHECK
Checks that all files belonging to a package have not been modified and are
not missing.
.It Sy DEPENDENCIES CHECK
Checks that all required dependencies for a package are resolved.
.It Sy OBSOLETE METADATA CHECK
Checks that the package database does not contain obsolete data from previous
XBPS versions and removes them if found.
.It Sy FORMAT CONVERSION
Updates the pkgdb format to the latest version.
.Sh OPTIONS
