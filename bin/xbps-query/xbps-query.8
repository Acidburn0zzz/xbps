.Sh NAME
.Nm xbps-query
.Nd XBPS utility to query for package and repository information
.Sh SYNOPSYS
.Nm xbps-query
.Op OPTIONS
.Ar MODE
.Op PKG
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints information of a specific package or packages stored
in target root directory or in registered repositories.
The argument
.Ar PKG
is a package expression, which is explained in the
.Em PACKAGE EXPRESSION
section.
.Sh PACKAGE EXPRESSION
A package expression is a form to match a pattern; currently xbps
supports 3 ways to specify them:
.Bl -dash
.It
by package name, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo .
The package with the greatest version available in all repositories will be choosen.
.It
by exact package name and version, i.e:
.Dq Sy foo-1.0_1 .
The first package matching expression in a repository will be choosen.
.It
by specifying a package name and version separated by any of the following version comparators:
.Bl -item -width xx -compact
.Pp
.It
.Sy <
less than
.It
.Sy >
greater than
.It
.Sy <=
less or equal than
.It
.Sy >=
greater or equal than
.Pp
Example:
.Dq Sy foo>=2.0 .
The first package matching expression in a repository will be choosen.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Fl C, Fl -config Ar file
Specifies a full path to the XBPS configuration file.
.It Fl c, Fl -cachedir Ar dir
Specifies a full path to the cache directory, where binary packages are stored.
.It Fl d, Fl -debug
Enables extra debugging shown to stderr.
.It Fl h, Fl -help
Show the help usage.
.It Fl p, Fl -property Ar PROP[,...]
Only match this package property.
Multiple properties can be specified by delimiting them with commas.
.It Fl R, Fl -repository=url
Enable repository mode. This mode explicitly looks in repositories, rather
than looking in the target root directory. The
.Ar url
argument is optional and can be used to add the repository to the top of the list.
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl r, Fl -rootdir Ar dir
Specifies a full path for the target root directory.
.It Fl v, Fl -verbose
Enables verbose messages.
.It Fl V, Fl -version
Shows the XBPS version.
.Sh MODE
Only one of the following modes can be used at a time.
By default and unless the
.Fl R
option is specified, the target
.Ar PKG
will be queried in the root directory, otherwise it will be
queried in registered repositories.
.Bl -tag -width -x
.It Fl l, Fl -list-pkgs
Lists registered packages in the package database (pkgdb).
A package can be in any of the following states:
.Bl -item -width xx -compact
.Pp
.It
.Sy ii
Package is installed.
.It
.Sy uu
Package is unpacked but must be configured with
.Xr xbps-reconfigure 8 .
.It
.Sy hr
Package is
.Sy half-removed ,
and can be fully removed with
.Xr xbps-remove 8 .
.It
.Sy ??
Package state is unknown.
.El
.It Fl H, Fl -list-hold-pkgs
List registered packages in the package database (pkgdb) that are on
.Sy hold .
Such packages won't be updated automatically.
.It Fl L, Fl -list-repos
Lists repositories and the number of packages contained on them. If a repository is not
available the number of packages will be
.Sy -1 .
The
.Fl v
option can be used to show more detailed information of remote repositories.
.It Fl m, Fl -list-manual-pkgs
Lists registered packages in the package database (pkgdb) that were installed
manually by the user (i.e not as dependency of any package).
.It Fl O, Fl -list-orphans
Lists package orphans in the package database (pkgdb), i.e packages that
were installed as dependencies and no package is currently depending on them
directly.
.It Fl o, Fl -ownedby Ar PATTERN...
Search for packages owning the files specified by
.Ar PATTERN .
The
.Ar PATTERN
argument can be a simple string or a shell wildcard pattern as explained in
.Xr fnmatch 3 .
Multiple patterns may be specified.
.It Fl s, Fl -search Ar PATTERN... [ Fl -property Ar PROP ]
Search for packages in repositories matching
.Ar PATTERN
on its
.Em pkgver
and/or
.Em short_desc
properties. The same rules explained in the
.Fl -ownedby
option are applied, but a
.Sy PACKAGE EXPRESSION
is also supported.
If a package property is specified with
.Fl -property,
all packages matching
.Ar PATTERN
against
.Ar PROP
will be shown.
.It Fl f, Fl -files Ar PKG
Show the package files for
.Ar PKG .
.It Fl x, Fl -deps Ar PKG
Show the required dependencies for
.Ar PKG .
Only direct dependencies are shown. To see a full dependency tree set it twice.
.It Fl X, Fl -revdeps Ar PKG
Show the reverse dependencies for
.Ar PKG .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width XBPS_TARGET_ARCH
.It Sy XBPS_ARCH
Overrides
.Xr uname 2
machine result with this value. Useful to install packages with a fake
architecture.
.It Sy XBPS_TARGET_ARCH
Sets the target architecture to this value. This variable differs from
.Sy XBPS_ARCH
in that it allows you to install packages partially, because
configuration phase is skipped (the target binaries might not be compatible with
the native architecture).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/db/xbps/.<pkgname>.plist
.It Ar /etc/xbps/xbps.conf
Default configuration file.
.It Ar /var/db/xbps/.<pkgname>.plist
Package metadata properties.
.It Ar /var/db/xbps/pkgdb-0.21.plist
Default package database (0.21 format). Keeps track of installed packages and properties.
.It Ar /var/cache/xbps
Default cache directory to store downloaded binary packages.

responsability and enjoy your life.
