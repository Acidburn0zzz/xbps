.Sh NAME
.Nm xbps-repo
.Nd XBPS command for binary package repositories
.Sh SYNOPSYS
.Nm xbps-repo
.Op options
.Ar target
.Op arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is able to interact with binary packages stored in local or
remote repositories. It is able to create a package index for local
repositories, list repositories, search for packages and show information
of a binary package in repository pool, among other things.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl C Ar conffile
Full path to the XBPS configuration file. By default set to
.Pa /etc/xbps/xbps.conf .
.It Fl c Ar cachedir
Sets the
.Em cache
directory to store downloaded binary packages from remote
repositories. By default set to
.Pa /var/cache/xbps .
.It Fl d
Enables extra debugging output to be shown to stderr.
.It Fl o Ar key Op key2,...
Used currently in the
.Em show
target. Prints the value of specified key(s) from
package's properties dictionary. Multiple keys can be specified delimited by
the comma character.
.It Fl r Ar rootdir
Sets the
.Em root
directory. By default the root directory is set to
.Em / .
Please note that the database directory is always set to
.Pa /var/db/xbps
independently of rootdir setting. So if you use a rootdir of
.Pa /blah ,
metadata stuff will go into
.Pa /blah/var/db/xbps .
.It Fl v
Shows verbose messages. Useful while installing and removing packages.
.It Fl V
Shows the current XBPS release version (version, API, index).
.Sh TARGETS
Please note that all targets are case insensitive.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ident
.It Sy find-files Ar pattern Ar [patterns ...]
Prints the name of
.Em package(s)
matching the pattern on its file list by looking in all repositories index files.
Multiple patterns can be specified as arguments.
.It Sy genindex Pa /path/to/local/repo
Generates a package index for a local repository as specified in its argument.
It will look for archives with the
.Sy .xbps
extension and will only add it into the index if version is newer than the one
available in the index. If a newer package is available, the old package file
will be removed automatically.
.It Sy list
Lists all working repositories in repository pool.
.It Sy pkg-list Op index
Lists all currently registered packages in repository index as specified
in the
.Ar index
argument. If argument is not specified, any package contained in all repositories
will be shown. The argument expects a decimal number starting from 0,
matching the output of the
.Ar list
target.
.It Sy search Ar pattern Ar [patterns ...]
Search for packages containing the shell
.Em pattern
(see
.Xr fnmatch 3 )
in its
.Em pkgname
or
.Em description
values in repository pool. Please note that patterns are matched in case
insensitive mode. Multiple patterns can be specified as arguments.
.It Sy show Ar pkgname | pkgpattern
Shows information for binary package
.Ar pkgname
or a package matching
.Ar pkgpattern .
This will print the size it takes in filesystem, description, maintainer,
architecture and other information. If specifying a pkgname, the newest
version available in repositories will be shown, otherwise the first
repository matching the pkgpattern will be used.
.It Sy show-deps Ar pkgname | pkgpattern
Shows run time dependencies for binary package
.Ar pkgname
or a package matching
.Ar pkgpattern .
The same rules than in the
.Em show
target also apply here.
.It Sy show-files Ar pkgname | pkgpattern
Shows the file list for the binary package
.Ar pkgname
or a package matching
.Ar pkgpattern .
The same rules than in the
.Em show
target also apply here.
.Em NOTE :
if a remote repository is the winner and binary package is not available in
.Em cachedir ,
it will fetch remotely and
.Em on the fly
the info from target repository.
.It Sy sync
Syncs the package index file for all registered remote repositories.
The index file will be fetched if local and remote size/mtime do not match.
