XBPS-REPO(8)
===========


NAME
----
xbps-repo - XBPS command for binary package repositories


SYNOPSIS
--------
*xbps-repo* ['options'] 'target' ['arguments']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The xbps-repo(8) command is used to handle local or remote binary
package repositories in the *XBPS binary package system*.
You can use it to create a package index for a local repository,
add or remove local and remote repositories, search for packages
and show information about a binary package in repository pool.


OPTIONS
-------
*-c* 'cachedir'::
	Sets the 'cache' directory to store downloaded binary packages
	from remote repositories.
	By default it's set to '/var/cache/xbps' and it's always relative
	to the 'root' directory. So if you use a 'rootdir' of '/blah',
	it will become '/blah/cachedir'.

*-r* 'rootdir'::
	Sets the 'root' directory. By default the root directory is
	set to '/'. Please note that the database directory is always
	set to '/var/db/xbps' independently of 'rootdir'. So if you
	use a 'rootdir' of '/blah', metadata stuff will go into
	'/blah/var/db/xbps'.

*-V*::
	Shows the current XBPS release version (library and code).


TARGETS
-------
Please note that all targets are *case insensitive*.

*add* 'URI'::
	Adds a repository as specified in 'URI' to the repository pool.
	Local (by specifying a *directory*) and remote (by specifiying an
	*HTTP/HTTPS/FTP URL*) repositories can be specified.

*genindex* '/path/to/local/repo'::
	Generates a package index for a local repository as specified in
	its argument. It will look for archives with *.xbps* extension
	and will only add it into the index if version is newer than the one
	available in the index. If a newer package is available, the
	for old package file will be removed automatically.

*list*::
	Lists all currently registered repositories in repository pool.

*remove* 'URI'::
	Removes a repository from repository pool as specified by the
	'URI' argument. You have to use the same 'URI' that was used
	in the *add* target.

*search* 'pattern'::
	Search for packages containing the shell 'pattern' (see fnmatch(3)) in
	its *pkgname* or *description* values in repository pool.

*show 'pkgname'*::
	Shows information about binary package 'pkgname'. This will print
	the size it takes in filesystem, description, maintainer, architecture
	and other information. The first repository in the pool wins. *NOTE:
	if a remote repository is the winner and binary package is not available
	in cachedir, it will fetch remotely and __on-the-fly__ the info*.

*show-deps 'pkgname'*::
	Shows run time dependencies for binary package 'pkgname'. The first
	repository in the pool wins.

*show-files 'pkgname'*::
	Shows the file list for a binary package 'pkgname' by searching it
	in repository pool. The first repository in the pool wins. *NOTE:
	if a remote repository is the winner and binary package is not
	available in `cachedir`, it will fetch remotely and __on-the-fly__
	the info*.

*sync*::
	Syncs the package index file for all registered remote repositories.
	The new file will be fetched if local and remote size/mtime do not match.

Probably, but I try to make this not happen. Use it under your own
responsability and enjoy your life.

To build binary packages, the xbps-src(8) shell script is the command
designed for this task. This must be retrieved from a GIT repository,
available at '<http://repo.or.cz/w/xbps.git>'.
