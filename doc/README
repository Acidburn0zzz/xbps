 WHAT IS IT?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

xbps - xtraeme's binary package ystem.

xbps is a new binary package system, taken ideas from other free available
implementations, such as dpkg/apt, RPM, pacman and others. Metadata handling
as package databases are handled by proplib. Multiple compression formats
are supported in binary packages thanks to libarchive.

xbps has been designed for Linux, and for the moment I'm not interested to
make it work on any other random OS. xbps is the base to create a basic
Linux system.

 REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

xbps uses proplib, a property container object library and it's almost the
same one available for NetBSD. Be sure to have it installed before using
xbps. You can get it at:

http://code.google.com/p/portableproplib/

I'm also the human maintaining the portable proplib package. I'd suggest you
to install it into /usr/local to avoid issues with your distribution packages.

To build the xbps utils, you'll need for both shared and dynamic:

	* asciidoc (to build the manpages)
	* libarchive (devel pkg)
	* proplib (devel pkg)
	* openssl (devel pkg)

If you only want to build the static binaries, you can pass STATIC=1
to the make command. You'll need development packages for the ones
mentioned above as well as the following:

	* attr (devel pkg with static lib)
	* acl (devel pkg with static lib)
	* zlib (devel pkg with static lib)
	* bzip2 (devel pkg with static lib)
	* xz (devel pkg with static lib)

Please note that when building the static binaries, the static libs
must match the requirements! please make sure that your installed
libarchive has all features built in (acl, zlib, bzip2, xz and openssl).

 HOW TO USE IT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before using xbps, some required utilities need to be built and installed
into $(PREFIX); by default they are installed into /usr/local.
You can do this by issuing "make" and "make install" as root in the top
level directory. See the REQUIREMENTS section above for required packages.

To build binary packages, you need xbps-src. It's stored in a public GIT
repository located at:

	http://repo.or.cz/w/xbps.git

For information about binary packages, see the BINPKG_INFO file.
