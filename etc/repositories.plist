	<!-- You can specify here your list of repositories,
	     the first repository that contains a package will
	     be used for most targets in xbps-bin(8) and
	     xbps-repo(8), with the exception for updating
	     on which all repositories will be looked at and
	     the newest version will be choosen.

	     Optionally a non default HTTP port can also be
	     specified like that:

		http://foo.local:8080/xbps-repo

	     The order matters, and the top-most matching a package
	     pattern or name will be used.

	     By default we use the official "public" repositories.
	     you can add your own local repositories by specifying
	     the path to the directory. -->
